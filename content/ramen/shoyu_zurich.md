![thumbnail: shoyu ramen](thumbnail.jpeg)

I cooked this ramen with a bunch of friends in Zurich. First time making ramen abroad, and first time making it for 7 people. A friend brought his pasta machine just for the occasion from Milan, it was his first time cooking ramen and he wanted to learn as much as possible, we had to make fresh noodles. It took 3 people and 3 hours the day before to prepare the noodles, and the full afternoon and evening to prepare everything else the following day.

The result was really good and I was extremely happy everything worked out well even with so many servings.
