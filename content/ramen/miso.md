![thumbnail: miso ramen](thumbnail.jpg)

I cooked this ramen at home with my brother at the end of the 2022 summer, a few weeks before leaving for my last year of studies. Summer in Bologna is really hot, so it's not the best time of the year to cook ramen, but I remember my brother really wanted to do one before I left.

We tried a bunch of new stuff in this recipe. It was my first time making dashi with kombu and katsuobushi, the broth was chicken wings and pork shoulder. The miso tare is a mix of a dark and a light miso. Toppings were charamelized pork (from the broth), marinaded eggs and green onion.

Pictures are particularly nice in this one because they were taken and edited by my brother.
