![thumbnail: shoyu ramen](thumbnail.jpeg)

This is the first ramen I cooked from scratch. It's also gluten free which did not make things easier!

It's a (not that successful) adaptation of [this recipe](http://www.halfbakedharvest.com/crockpot-crispy-caramelized-pork-ramen-noodle-soup-wcurry-roasted-acorn-squash/).
